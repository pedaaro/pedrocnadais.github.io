    While I&apos;m mainly focused on frontend development, I believe it&apos;s crucial to be versatile across all aspects of a project. I enjoy working with React because of how its components seamlessly interact. For backend, Node.js is my go-to choice. In my view, PostgreSQL is the best database to work withâ€”very user-friendly. I&apos;m proactive with an entrepreneurial mindset, finding satisfaction in supporting the team and driving results. Feel free to reach out; I&apos;m always up for a chat.
